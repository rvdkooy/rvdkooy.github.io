Writing your own view framework, really? why do you want to do that?


Well, for more than a year now I've been working on a large project where I decided to use ReactJs for building the web frontend.
Building and composing the UI with components that will rerender when state changes with ReactJS is a great paradigm and it turned out to be a very good choice for us.

So, I really wanted to know how all of this worked and aftere analyzing their source code on github (that was not easy to grasp btw), I decided to build a similar thing by myself to truly understand the concept.

I named my view framework 'Reren' and after several tries, I now have a 'version' that contains the basic building blocks for creating and composing components that can have its own state and rerenders when it changes with the help of my own virtual DOM.

I recorded this video to explain the reasoning, how to build a simple component and an existing todo app build with Reren.

Some lessons that I've learned while writing Reren (that also apply to ReactJs):

- The elements that you construct in your component !== virtual DOM. They only describe the desired html output. Based on that a new virtual DOM will be constructed later on to be compared with the previous virtual DOM.
- when comparing 2 versions of a virtual DOM you can do some 'naive' approaches. For example: when traversing the virtual DOM tree and detecting that a tag was changed from a `span` to a `div`, the best thing to do is to throw away the `span` and all its underlying children (without even looking further) and rebuild the tree from there (continue with the `div` and it's children). This sounds very strange, but most of the time this is exactly what you want and implementing a smart diffing algorithm that can detect a potential more efficient way too do this is way [too CPU expensive](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html#motivation). So this is an accepted tradeoff.
- Every element or component in a list needs a unique key to uniquely identify it for detecting a change in order. An index is not good enough because when the order of items change the index will be the same, resulting in a very ineffecient diff between the current and previous virtual DOM.
- I had to write out all the possibilies when comparing two trees and writing tests for it was an absolute MUST to prevent regression bugs!

I really enjoyed doing this and I encourage everyone who want to know more about any subject to do something similar.

Note:
To be clear here: Reren is not intended to be used in production, it was only used as an exercise!

Well thatâ€™s all there is!!
